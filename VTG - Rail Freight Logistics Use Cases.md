## 1. Manual Maintenance of ETD/ATD/ETA/ATA for Block Trains  
**German:** *Manuelles ETD/ATD/ETA/ATA pflegen bei Blockzügen*

### Core Concept  
This involves the **manual updating** of time-related data for block trains (also known as unit or direct trains). These trains travel without re-shunting between origin and destination, optimizing freight efficiency.

### Definitions

- **ETD** – *Estimated Time of Departure*: Planned departure time  
- **ATD** – *Actual Time of Departure*: Actual time the train departed  
- **ETA** – *Estimated Time of Arrival*: Planned arrival time  
- **ATA** – *Actual Time of Arrival*: Actual time the train arrived  

### Use Case Summary  
**Category:** Real-Time Operations Tracking and Visibility  
When automated systems fail or require human validation, manual entry of ETD/ATD/ETA/ATA is essential. This data is critical for:

- Customer visibility  
- Supply chain synchronization  
- Performance measurement  

**Challenge:** Manual intervention indicates a potential area for **process automation or system integration**.

## 2. Manual Creation of Train Lists  
**German:** *Manuelle Anlage von Zuglisten (12-stellige Waggonnummern ...)*

### Core Concept  
This task includes compiling a list of wagons in a train — each uniquely identified by a **12-digit wagon number**, following international standards.

### Use Case Summary  
**Category:** Asset Management and Shipment Planning  
Precise identification of wagons (e.g., specific tank wagons for chemicals) supports:

- Fleet inventory tracking  
- Maintenance scheduling  
- Contractual transport verification  

**Challenge:** Train lists may be created manually when:

- Systems do not auto-generate them  
- Verifications or corrections are needed  
- Trains are composed of wagons from multiple customer bookings  

**Impact:** The process is **time-consuming and error-prone**, highlighting a need for digitalization.

---

## 3. Request for Quotation (RFQ) – Spot Trains and Individual Relations  
**German:** *RFQ für Spot-Trains und Einzelrelationen*

### Core Concept  
Handling **RFQs** for short-notice or non-contractual shipments:

- **Spot Trains**: Full trains for one-off or short-term bookings  
- **Einzelrelationen**: One or few wagons between specific start/end points  

### Use Case Summary  
**Category:** Sales, Pricing, and Capacity Management  
Responding to RFQs involves:

- Verifying wagon availability  
- Estimating operational costs  
- Assessing capacity and market rates  
- Preparing timely offers for ad-hoc shipments  

**Goal:** Streamline the quotation process and improve **speed-to-offer** through automation and better system integration.
